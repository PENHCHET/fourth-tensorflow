Forth attempt at making tensorflow easier for windows users

Looking into including Torch and Open-Al-Gym

Torch seems to install, but useing the demo installs too large a file to work with the free version of Cloud9, so you would have to pay a small monthly fee.

Open-Al-gym seems to install and I am working on how to use it.
